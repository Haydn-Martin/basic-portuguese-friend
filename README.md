# basic-portuguese-friend
A basic script to perform basic (and bad) voice chat in Portuguese.

A basic conversation bot that allows you to practice Portuguese by
listening to an input and responding coherently. Simply run the script
and start talking. Here's what to expect:

![basic_convo_demo_audio.mp4](https://github.com/Haydn-Martin/basic-portuguese-friend/blob/main/basic_convo_demo_audio.mp4)

Using:

- [pyaudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)
- [groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/overview)
- [realtimeTTS](https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeTTS)

As stated above, this isn't quite good enough to use. I have
experimented with it extensively. Major problems are:

- Robotic response tone
- Speaking speed too slow
- Response time too slow
- Voice detection too basic

This type of tool should be usable either right now by using paid
tools such as ... or in the near-future (I'm talking 2025) locally
for very low cost using simple APIs and open source libraries.

I may re-visit this repo again when this is the case.
